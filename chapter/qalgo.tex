\subsection{Stoicheometric Correction in NCX channel}

Trapped ion Quantum Computer is already in practice. There are interesting application of Quantum Physics phenomena in Quantum Biology (e.g., Photosynthesis and Mutation). In case of trapped ion, the spin of ion can be considered as a quantum qubit. In this article we want to study the interaction of three Na ions and Ca ion during the exchange process in NCX channel.
